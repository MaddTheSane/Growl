			<h3>Allow Growl to start at login</h3>
			<p>
			In order for applications to send notifications to Growl, Growl needs to be running.  The best way to ensure that Growl is running all the time, is to let us start at login.  Clicking the button below will enable Growl to start at login.  You can change this setting at any time in the <a href="growl://preferences/general">General settings</a></p>
