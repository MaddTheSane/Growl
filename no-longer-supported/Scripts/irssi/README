In order to install and run this irssi plugin, you must have 3 things preinstalled:

1) irssi with perl support. 

To get perl support in irssi, do one of the following:

When configuring irssi, do this:
./configure --with-perl=yes


or, if you have a install of darwinports, do this:
sudo port install irssi +perl


2) A working Growl install.


3) Mac::Growl installed.
Available as part of the 'bindings' package
 http://growl.info/downloads_developers.php


Once you have these three, move growl.pl to ~/.irssi/scripts/ and then run this command in irssi:

/script load growl.pl

You should get a visual notification that growl installed.
