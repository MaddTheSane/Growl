\f2\b About:
\f1\b0 \
Growl is a system wide notifications system. This provides for a uniform notification from any application that supports Growl, and also allows you to choose how they appear. Growl notifications can be used, for example, for small bits of output or to tell you that a process has finished.\
\

\f2\b Installation:
\f1\b0 \
The first thing you will want to do is double click Growl.pkg.\

\f2\b Use:\

\f1\b0 You can then configure Growl how you like. You can use a Bubble or a Bezel currently. Future versions of Growl will have other looks as well. You can add display plug\'d0ins in the Library/Application Support/Growl/Plugins folder, which should appear after you turn on Growl for the first time.\
\
Applications must register with Growl before they can use Growl. You can see what applications are registered with Growl via the Applications tab of the preferences. Applications usually register when they launch, so if an application says it\'d5s Growl-enabled but it isn\'d5t in the list, try relaunching it.\
\
You can turn off notifications for whole applications or for just one notification type within an application by simply unchecking the checkbox for each. Be sure to hit apply when done.\
