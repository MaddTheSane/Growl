Growldict
______________________________________

How to use it:
Growldict is a simple service that runs in the background. To use it simply highlight a  word and select lookup word from the services menu under the currently running application's name in the menu bar. Alternatively you can just press command-shift-F . Growl will popup a bubble with the definition of the word.

How it works:
Growldict does a lookup by calling curl on your machine and having it do a query using the dict protocol against the dict.org server. The key combination is located in the Info.plist within the app, although this will be customizeable at some point. The location of the server is within the code itself, but this also will become customizeable in the future.
