FeedLibrary
	
	This is the top level object that manages the rest of the model objects (Feeds and Articles). The feedRoot
	instance variable is an NSMutableDictionary that represents everything that will be written to disk and
	it has the following top level keys (constants defined at top of FeedLibrary.m):
		
		LibraryFeedRoot
			This is master storage for all 'items' in the library. Items are the opaque storage mechanism
			used to store Feeds, Folders and Articles in the source NSOutlineView. More on items below.
			
		LibrarySourceIndex
			This is a simple shortcut dictionary that maps from source URL directly to the Feed object in
			the LibraryFeedRoot
			
		LibraryVersion
			Version number for the library. This only changes when the on-disk archive is no longer backwards
			compatible, and is still sitting at 1.
			
		LibraryActiveFeedItems
			This is a shortcut array into LibraryFeedRoot that tracks the currently selected items.
			
		LibraryActiveArticles
			This is a shortcut array that holds the currently visible articles based on the selection in
			LibraryActiveFeedItems.
			
		LibraryActiveArticleIndex
			This is the index of the currently selected article in LibraryActiveArticles. In the case
			of multiple selection, this is set to NSNotFound (ie, there IS no active article when there
			is a multiple selection)
			
		LibraryDeletedArticleKeys
			These are articles that have been deleted, but are still visible in currently downloaded sources.
			This is used to suppress re-adding articles that the user has deleted when updating a source.
			
		LibraryItemKeyIndex
			This is a shortcut map of unique item keys to their corresponding item in the LibraryFeedRoot.
			
		LibrarySelectedArticles
			This doesn't seem to be used at the moment. It was used before I started storing the currently
			selected articles directly in the items themselves, and appears to now be a relic.
