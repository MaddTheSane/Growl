About:
	HardwareGrowler will send growl notifications when devices are connected or disconnected from the Mac.

Supported 'Devices':
	¥ FireWire
	¥ USB
	¥ Bluetooth
	¥ FileSystem Volumes
	¥ Network Interfaces

Bugs:
	I can't get the name of many FireWire devices 
		- it may be that they don't even have them.

	It should probably run without appearing in the dock.

	It has a terrible icon.
	
	It should probably have some kind of preferences UI where the user can disable start-up notifications. ("OHCI Root Hub Simulation")
