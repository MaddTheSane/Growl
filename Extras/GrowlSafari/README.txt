GrowlSafari

GrowlSafari is a plug-in to Safari to make it post Growl notifications on download-related events.

Currently, GrowlSafari posts notifications for these events:
* Decompression started
* Copying disk image
* Download complete
* Mounting disk image

GrowlSafari works in all versions of Safari (except 1.0) on Mac OS X 10.3 or later.


Installation:

Requires SIMBL (http://culater.net/software/SIMBL/SIMBL.php)

Once SIMBL is installed, put GrowlSafari.bundle into /Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins
Restart Safari.

You should now receive Growl notifications when downloads complete.
