To-Do

Growl:
	PrefPane:
		Turn on buttons in the prefpane that machina added ?
	Growl Itself:
		save to an Application Support Directory to be accessible from the Prefpane and app 
		write the protocol to which Notification Plugins conform	
		- Easy enough to do.  I will get on this, because I am adding some features to the pref pane, and want to make some standardized thing (graphite)
		
			then write the glue/controller for the bubbles notifications to work 
		Decide what types of notifications we want to include (bezel, square, bubbles, speech, beeps, etc)
			The default notification Plugin will be in Growl.syspref/Resources/
			Make default install directory for display plugins ~/Library/Application Support/Growl/
		Add a define/macro to GrowlDefines that can get the display plugins
