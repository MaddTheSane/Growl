To-Do

- Growl:
	- PrefPane:
	- Growl Itself:
		save to an Application Support Directory to be accessible from the Prefpane and app 
		write the protocol to which Notification Plugins conform	
		{Easy enough to do.  I will get on this, because I am adding some features to the pref pane, and want to make some standardized thing (graphite)}
		
			then write the glue/controller for the bubbles notifications to work 
		Decide what types of notifications we want to include (bezel, square, bubbles, speech, beeps, etc)
			The default notification Plugin will be in Growl.syspref/Resources/
			Make default install directory for display plugins ~/Library/Application Support/Growl/
		Add a define/macro to GrowlDefines that can get the display plugins


- Bindings
	- Real Basic:
		Real Basic Binding needs to be coded 
	- Python:
		Write a C extension for python so we do not rely on PyObjc anymore
	- Perl:
		Setup a way for icons to be displayed
		Implementation documentation needs to be written
		Get this submitted to CPAN
			This requires making the perl module install growl if growl is not installed
	- Carbon:
	- TCL:
		Use the AppBridge to launch growl if needed. 
		Rather than building with -I../.., use the header from Growl.framework. 
		Refactor the code, primarily to separate out the Tcl<->C bits from the C<->ObjC bits. 
	- Ruby:
		Ruby Interface needs to be coded
	- Java:
		A java binding would be nice
	- Applescript:

- Sample Apps and Code:
	- Beep Specific To DO:
		Connect sheet 
	- GrowlTunes Specific To DO:
		Make it work with streams (e.g. iTMS previews, radio stuff)
		Grab album art from the web
			We have a plugin architecture in GrowlTunes for this.
