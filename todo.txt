To-Do

For .7

-Functional plugins
	- Design a way for functional plugins to work
	- Move rendezvous out of display plugins into a functional plugin that would allow for any notification.


- Uber passive registration
	- A GrowlNotifications.plist resource in App bundles that we read on their launch/install to allow them to register
	- This is for when the app would have a large amount of notifs to prepare or to seperate it out from code and make it
	  more flexible on app updates and such
	- Watching app launches and checking on apps for these resources
- Provide a way to easily get version via command line

For .8 (The Kitchen Sink) or sooner
- Display plugins

- Preference pane redesign
	- Apps tab switch to app centric with custom View for notifications using images to represent the available options
	- first tab have Growl image and dev names, maybe even an easter egg, controls for turning features on/off 
	  ie. (GrowlHelperApp, Network Notifications, Sound to accompany notifications, Speech, Menu Item, etc)



- Other

For .9 or sooner
- Downloads tab
	- This will allow for display plugins to be distributed separate from Growl itself.
	- Load information from a plist.
	- Possibly allow for a webkit view to allow for artistic displays/easy previews.
	- growlview:// (or something similar) for loading display plugins
	- Only load from http://growl.info.
	- We can put displays like NSLog and MailMe here once we have this.
	- New displays can be distributed via this method. We can also use this to find out if a display plugin is the currently available version or not.
	- Some displays won't work on 10.2. In six months to a year, some won't work on 10.3. We need to prepare for this.

Other stuff; old todo

- Bindings
	- REALbasic:
		REALbasic Binding needs to be finished
		Documentation on this
	- Perl:
		Implementation documentation needs to be written
		Get this submitted to CPAN
			This requires making the perl module install growl if growl is not installed

- Documentation for the entourage and mail.app scripts. These should have screen shots, and be on the website.
	ref: http://cia.navi.cx/stats/author/the_tick/.message/2670177 for entourage.

- Sample Apps and Code:
	- GrowlTunes Specific To DO:
		Make GrowlTunes work with streams (e.g. iTMS previews, radio stuff)
		Prefs and HotKeys
	- growlnotify:
		Make a .pkg, install into /usr/local
