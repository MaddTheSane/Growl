Mac-Growl version 0.20
======================

Mac::Growl provides an interface for perl scripts to connect to Growl,
allowing them to register with it, and send it notifications to be
displayed.

See http://growl.info for more information on growl,
or consult man Mac::Growl or perldoc Mac::Growl after installation for
more details on the module, or perldoc lib/Mac/Growl.pm beforehand.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

make test will register "PerlApp" with growl with Growl, with one
notification, "PerlApp-Test", and then post that notification with a message.
Please note, the first time you make test, the notification make take a
significant amount of time to appear, while Growl searches for an icon for
the non-existent "PerlApp". This will be fixed in a later version.
Also note, since there is currently no Growl->Caller communication, there is
no way for the test script to tell if it's working, and therefore will always
report sucess. If you don't see the notification, check console, wait a while
and try again, and/or ask in #growl on irc.freenode.net.

DEPENDENCIES

This module should work on any Mac OS X system, although it requires
the developer tools to build and install.
