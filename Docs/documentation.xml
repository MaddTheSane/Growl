					<para>Click on the <emphasis>Start Growl</emphasis> button.  Optionally check the <emphasis>Start on Login</emphasis> checkbox. If this is not checked, you will need to manually start Growl before you can see notifications.</para>

				<title>You have Growl, now what?</title>
				<sect2>
					<title>How does registration work?</title>
					<sect3>
						<title>Why is the Applications tab empty?</title>
						<para>You have just downloaded and installed Growl. You have opened up System Preferences, clicked on the Applications tab, and it is empty?! What in the world?</para>
						<para>That is the reaction we get from a lot of people new to Growl. Growl is what we like to refer to as a tool for other applications. Now, we don't want to include a list of all of the possible applications in the default installation, because you probably will not be using them all. We also don't know if you would want to even use the applications we have made as examples. So with the default installation of Growl, the applications tab is meant to be empty.</para>
						<para>Have no fear. Soon it should fill up with whatever Growl enabled applications that you may have. When a Growl enabled application tries to talk to Growl, it does something called <code>Registration</code>. It registers with Growl so that Growl knows what notifications it may send out (so that Growl can list them in its preferences). This is true for scripts as well, anything from AppleScript to Tcl will register.</para>
						<para>For the most part, all you will have to do is just launch the application. There are some exceptions. Some applications use filters or rules or whatever was chosen to allow their users control over the whole process within their application as well. If the application you want to use with Growl does not show up in the Applications tab after launching it, look in preferences. If you still don't see it, you can email us at discuss &#x41;&#x54; growl.info and we can look into the problem.</para>
					</sect3>
					<sect3>
						<title>So what now?</title>
						<para>Once the application has a registration in the Applications tab, you can control it. You can control all Growl based notifications through this one central location. You can also choose how each notification will appear. One notification can use the Bubbles display, another can use the Music Video display, and a third can use the Bezel display. You can also choose which applications will stay on the screen until clicked, and which ones will not.</para>

					<title>Displaying notifications</title>
					<para>When an application (or script) wants to display a notification to the user (that's you), it sends the information to a background application running on your Mac called GrowlHelperApp. GrowlHelperApp will then, depending on your preferences, show the notification using one of the display plug-ins.</para>

									<title>Sticky Notifications</title>
									<para>Sticky notifications will stay on screen until clicked.</para>   
									<para>The 'Sticky' checkbox allows you to decide which notification types are allowed to become sticky, or even force them to be sticky.   The checkbox has three states:  '<emphasis>On</emphasis>', '<emphasis>Off</emphasis>', and '<emphasis>Mixed</emphasis>'.</para>   
									<para><emphasis>'Off'</emphasis> means that those types of notifications can never become sticky, even if an application requests them to be.  <emphasis>'On'</emphasis> forces them to be sticky. <emphasis>'Mixed'</emphasis> (looks like a bar -  see the screenshot above) is the default setting; it means that the application that issues the notification is allowed to decide whether or not notifications of that type should be sticky.</para>

					<para>Once you have installed GrowlTunes, double click it. This will put the headphones shown here in the menubar at the top of your screen. From here you can control GrowlTunes.</para>

					<para>For users of iTunes 4.7 and later, that is all you have to do to get GrowlTunes working. Note: GrowlTunes does not poll for its information with iTunes 4.7 and later.</para>
					<para>For iTunes 4.6 and below, the most important part of using GrowlTunes is the polling button at the bottom of the menu. This allows you to turn on and off polling of iTunes (asking it what song is currently being played).</para>
					<para>Once you get GrowlTunes to start polling, you should see a bubble like the image below. You will see one of these each time the track changes in iTunes.</para>

					<title>Artwork</title>
					<para>Starting with Growl 0.6, GrowlTunes can get artwork from Amazon.com. (Growl 0.5 came with a version that did not have this capability.) If GrowlTunes does not see artwork in the current track playing, and it also does not see that the album artwork was previously downloaded, it will download the track. GrowlTunes does not write this information to the track, but instead to files on disk. GrowlTunes will place the downloaded artwork in your home directory, in Library/Images/Music.</para>

					<title>About GrowlMail</title>
					<para>GrowlMail is a plug-in for <ulink url="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/mail/">Apple Mail</ulink> that posts a Growl notification every time new mail arrives containing the text of the message.</para>
				</sect3>
				<sect3>
					<title>Installing GrowlMail</title>
					<para>Move the GrowlMail.mailbundle package into <code>~/Library/Mail/Bundles/</code>, quit Mail.app, and run the following 2 commands in the terminal:</para>
					<blockquote>
						<code>defaults write com.apple.mail EnableBundles -bool True
defaults write com.apple.mail BundleCompatibilityVersion 1</code>
					</blockquote>
					<para>Now relaunch Mail.app. Whenever new mail arrives, Growl will display a notification.</para>

					<title>Compiling GrowlMail yourself</title>
					<para><emphasis>If you're happy with the pre-built GrowlMail available at the <ulink url="http://growl.info/downloads.php">Downloads</ulink> page, you don't need to read this section.</emphasis></para>
					<para>GrowlMail relies on having Growl compiled and installed, and Growl.framework compiled (the framework does not need to be installed anywhere). Once these tasks are complete, compiling GrowlMail is easy.</para>
					<para>GrowlMail lives in the <code>Extras/GrowlMail/</code> directory. Simply open GrowlMail.xcode, select the build style you wish to use, and build. The finished product will be called <code>GrowlMail.mailbundle</code> and will be in the <code>build</code> directory.</para>

				<sect3>
					<title>About</title>
					<para><code>growlnotify</code> is a command-line tool to post Growl notifications. You can control all aspects of the notification (within any boundaries set up in the Growl pane of System Preferences). It can be very useful in shell scripts.</para>
				</sect3>

				<sect3>
					<title>Installing</title>
					<para>In your shell, cd to the directory on the Growl disk image containing <code>growlnotify</code>, and type <code>./install.sh</code>. That script will install <code>growlnotify</code> to <code>/usr/local/bin</code> and the manpage to <code>/usr/local/man</code>.</para>
				</sect3>

				<sect3>
					<title>Building from sources</title>
					<para>Running '<code>make</code>' will build <code>growlnotify</code> into your build folder if you want to test it before installation.</para>
					<para>Running '<code>make install</code>' will install <code>growlnotify</code> into <code>/usr/local/bin</code> and install the manpage into <code>/usr/local/man</code>. It will also do a build first if necessary.</para>
					<para>The Makefile uses <code>xcodebuild</code> internally, with the Deployment buildstyle.</para>
				</sect3>

				<sect3>
					<title>Usage</title>
					<code>
Usage: growlnotify [-hs] [-i ext] [-I filepath] [--image filepath]
[-p priority] [title]
Options:
    -h,--help     Display this help
    -n,--name     Set the name of the application that sends the notification
                  [Default: growlnotify]
    -s            Make the notification sticky
    -a,--appIcon  Specify an application name  to take the icon from
    -i,--icon     Specify a file type or extension to look up for
    the notification icon
    -I,--iconpath Specify a file whose icon will be the notification icon
    --image       Specify an image file to be used for the notification icon
    -p,--priority Specify an int or named key (default is 0)

Display a notification using the title given on the command-line and the
message given in the standard input.

Priority can be one of the following named keys: Very Low, Moderate, 
Normal, High,
Emergency. It can also be an int between -2 and 2.

To be compatible with gNotify the following switches are accepted:
    -t,--title    Does nothing. Any text following will be treated as the
                  title because that's the default argument behaviour
    -m,--message  Sets the message to the following instead of using stdin
    </code>

					<para>The manpage provides more information on the usage of <code>growlnotify</code>. Just type '<code>man 1 growlnotify</code>' after installing <code>growlnotify</code>.</para>
