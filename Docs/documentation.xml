					<para>Click on the <emphasis>Start Growl</emphasis> button.  Optionally check the <emphasis>Start on Login</emphasis> checkbox. If this is not checked, you will need to manually start Growl before you can see notifications.</para>

				<title>You have Growl, now what?</title>
				<sect2>
					<title>How does registration work?</title>
					<sect3>
						<title>Why is the Applications tab empty?</title>
						<para>You have just downloaded and installed Growl. You have opened up System Preferences, clicked on the Applications tab, and it is empty?! What in the world?</para>
						<para>That is the reaction we get from a lot of people new to Growl. Growl is what we like to refer to as a tool for other applications. Now, we don't want to include a list of all of the possible applications in the default installation, because you probably will not be using them all. We also don't know if you would want to even use the applications we have made as examples. So with the default installation of Growl, the applications tab is meant to be empty.</para>
						<para>Have no fear. Soon it should fill up with whatever Growl enabled applications that you may have. When a Growl enabled application tries to talk to Growl, it does something called <code>Registration</code>. It registers with Growl so that Growl knows what notifications it may send out (so that Growl can list them in its preferences). This is true for scripts as well, anything from AppleScript to Tcl will register.</para>
						<para>For the most part, all you will have to do is just launch the application. There are some exceptions. Some applications use filters or rules or whatever was chosen to allow their users control over the whole process within their application as well. If the application you want to use with Growl does not show up in the Applications tab after launching it, look in preferences. If you still don't see it, you can email us at discuss &#x41;&#x54; growl.info and we can look into the problem.</para>
					</sect3>
					<sect3>
						<title>So what now?</title>
						<para>Once the application has a registration in the Applications tab, you can control it. You can control all Growl based notifications through this one central location. You can also choose how each notification will appear. One notification can use the Bubbles display, another can use the Music Video display, and a third can use the Bezel display. You can also choose which applications will stay on the screen until clicked, and which ones will not.</para>

					<title>Displaying notifications</title>
					<para>When an application (or script) wants to display a notification to the user (that's you), it sends the information to a background application running on your Mac called GrowlHelperApp. GrowlHelperApp will then, depending on your preferences, show the notification using one of the display plug-ins.</para>

					<title>The Growl Preference Pane</title>
					<para>The Growl preference pane has three tabs:</para>

									</inlinemediaobject>
								</para>
								<para>You have complete control over which notifications are displayed on your computer - In the 'Applications' tab you can configure which notifications are active - and which display they use.</para>
								<sect4>
									<title>Priority</title>
									<para>You can set differing priorities to different notification types.  This may affect the way in which your notifications are presented to you, depending on the chosen display.</para>
								</sect4>
								<sect4>
									<title>Sticky Notifications</title>
									<para>Sticky notifications will stay on screen until clicked.</para>   
									<para>The 'Sticky' checkbox allows you to decide which notification types are allowed to become sticky, or even force them to be sticky.   The checkbox has three states:  '<emphasis>On</emphasis>', '<emphasis>Off</emphasis>', and '<emphasis>Mixed</emphasis>'.</para>   
									<para><emphasis>'Off'</emphasis> means that those types of notifications can never become sticky, even if an application requests them to be.  <emphasis>'On'</emphasis> forces them to be sticky. <emphasis>'Mixed'</emphasis> (looks like a bar -  see the screenshot above) is the default setting; it means that the application that issues the notification is allowed to decide whether or not notifications of that type should be sticky.</para>
								</sect4>

						<listitem>
							<sect3>
								<title>Display Options</title>
								<para>Display Options is where you can configure what you are shown when Growl notifies you.</para>
								<para>

								</para>
								<para>First you select which display you would like to configure. Then you can change settings on each display however you wish. Some displays have priority settings, some provide preference on the transparency, etc.</para>

				<title>Removing Growl, if you need to</title>
				<para>When you install Growl from the .pkg installer, it installs the following files in these locations:</para>
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem>GrowlAppBridge.framework: /Library/Frameworks/</listitem>
					<listitem>Growl.prefpane: /Library/PreferencePanes/</listitem>
				</itemizedlist>
				<para>The first time you run Growl, it will also create a folder in your <emphasis>Library/Application Support/</emphasis> directory called <emphasis>Growl</emphasis>. This folder contains some data that Growl uses, as well as a folder called <emphasis>Plugins</emphasis>.</para>
				<para>

				</para>
				<para>If you trash all of these, log out, and then log back in, Growl will be uninstalled. You can now empty your trash.</para>
				<para>One note, if you are uninstalling Growl for a reason that the developers might want to know about, please email us at discuss &#x41;&#x54; growl.info and we can look into fixing those problems.</para>
