SSL issue.
In a recent build I noticed that switching notifaction types in the general tab don't take effect like the last build. So I stoped and started growl which fixed it before, only this time it won't start back up.
Console says:

GrowlHelperApp.app/Contents/MacOS/GrowlHelperApp can't open library: /usr/lib/libcrypto.0.9.7.dylib  (No such file or directory, errno = 2)
