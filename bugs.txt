-SSL issue.

In a recent build I noticed that switching notifaction types in the general tab don't take effect like the last build. So I stoped and started growl which fixed it before, only this time it won't start back up.
Console says:

GrowlHelperApp.app/Contents/MacOS/GrowlHelperApp can't open library: /usr/lib/libcrypto.0.9.7.dylib  (No such file or directory, errno = 2)

-Response to SSL issue:

The basic problem is that OpenSSL 0.9.6 and 0.9.7 are not compatible. Jaguar ships with 0.9.6, Panther ships with 0.9.7.

Apple screwed up the install_name of the Jaguar libs (used libcrypto.0.9.dylib instead of libcrypto.0.9.6.dylib). So, for backwards compatibility's sake, Panther also ships with OpenSSL 0.9.6, as libcrypto.0.9.dylib/libssl.0.9.dylib. The other ssl/crypto libs are OpenSSL 0.9.7.

So, the possible solutions are:

(a) Link with libcrypto.0.9.dylib, which exists on Jaguar and Panther.
(b) Do separate builds for Jaguar and Panther (many SSL-enabled apps do this).

I'd recommend (a), for obvious reasons.
