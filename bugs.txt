 < pixie> thanks...... i really wish to use the latest version of growl from subversion wish someone could tell me 
          what's wrong :(
 < eventualbuddha> does it work at all?
 < pixie> nope 0.5 works but when i installed the one from subversion
 < pixie> it seems to stop on its own and no notification shows
 < eventualbuddha> so you start it, and then all of a sudden it stops?
 < pixie> yes
 < eventualbuddha> with no console entries?
 < pixie> when i go back to the preference pane its stopped 
 < pixie> ah now it works
 < pixie> hope it doesn't stop on its own though :(
 < eventualbuddha> go to the Applications folder and then open Utilities
 < eventualbuddha> open Console
 < eventualbuddha> see if there are any items that list Growl or GrowlHelperApp or something like that
 < pixie> that's the last one
