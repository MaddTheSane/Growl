This should be checked out into the extensions/growl directory of your Mozilla
source tree. To enable it to be built, you have to add this to your .mozconfig:
ac_add_options --enable-extensions=default,growl

In order to build this extension, you must download the Growl-WithInstaller
framework, which is available from the Growl SDK:
http://growl.info/downloads_developers.php

Just copy it into the root folder of the extension, and you'll be all set.
