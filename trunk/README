This should be checked out into the extensions/growl directory of your Mozilla
source tree. To enable it to be built, you have to add this to your .mozconfig:
ac_add_options --enable-extensions=default,growl

When building this, go into your object directory, in extensions/growl and type
make.  This will produce the xpi in obj-dir/dist/xpi-stage.
