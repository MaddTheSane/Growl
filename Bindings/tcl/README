== About ==

This is a very basic Tcl binding to Growl (http://growl.info/). At present, it will simply not work if Growl isn't running.

== Installation ==

(1) Change to this directory.
(2) Type 'make'
(3) Type 'sudo make install'

The package will be installed as /Library/Tcl/growl1.0/libgrowl.dylib

== Usage (from Tcl) ==

% package require growl
1.0
% growl register appName [list of notification types]
% growl post type title desc

== To do ==

Use the AppBridge to launch growl if needed.
Add support for notification icons.
Refactor the code, separate out the Tcl<->C bits from the C<->ObjC bits.
Rather than using ../../GrowlDefines.h, use the header from Growl.framework.
